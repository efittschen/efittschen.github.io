Hello, my name is Elisabeth and I will be applying to CS (NLP) PhD positions in the 2025 cycle. 

I am a Master's student at the University of Hamburg âš“, and am currently a visiting student at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) under the supervision of Dr. [Tom Lippincott](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/thomas-lippincott/). Prior to this, I completed a Bachelor's of Computer Science at the Technical University of Clausthal, where my thesis focused on real time computer graphics optimization (transparency rendering in raytracing).

My research interests lie in the efficiency of modern language models and questions surrounding how to best extend their recursive reasoning abilities.
