Hello, my name is Elisabeth and I will be applying to CS (NLP) PhD positions in the 2025 cycle. 
I am a masters student at the University of Hamburg, and currently participating in an exchange semester at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) under the supervision of Prof. Tom Lippincott. Before I completed a Computer Science Bachelors at the Technical University of Clausthal with a Bachelor Thesis on real time computer graphics optimisation (transparency rendering in raytracing).

My research interest lie in the efficiency of modern Language Models and the question of how to best extend their recursive reasoning abilities.
