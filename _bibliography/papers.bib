abstract = {The Language of Zelda is an educational game that re-imagines “The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past” for French language learning. With the integration of ChatGPT for non-player characters (NPCs), the game allows players to interact with NPCs to practice French through gameplay, puzzles, and quests. Our approach bridges the gap between declarative and procedural language knowledge, offering an engaging, immersive learning experience. The game’s adaptive dialogues cater to various proficiency levels, enhancing both education and entertainment values. Our work illustrates the potential of combining AI with game-based learning to create effective, enjoyable language education tools.},
